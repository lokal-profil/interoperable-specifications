# Rules for interoperable specifications

The rules for interoperable specifications are divided into six parts. The first five apply to anyone creating or distributing an interoperable specification, the last one applies mainly to actors harvesting interoperable specifications:

1. Rules for interoperable specifications - PROF-INSPEC - based on [[[DX-PROF]]]
2. Rules for data vocabularies - RDFS-INSPEC - based on [[[RDF-SCHEMA]]]
3. Rules for terminologies - SKOS-INSPEC - based on [[[SKOS-REFERENCE]]]
4. Rules for application profiles - SHACL-INSPEC - based on [[[SHACL]]]
5. Rules for diagrams - SVG-INSPEC - based on [[[SVG11]]]
6. Rules for enriching the interoperable specifications - ENRICH-INSPEC

## Rules for interoperable specifications - PROF-INSPEC

<img src="pics/interoperable_specifications_overview.svg" width="800">

For a specification to be considered a interoperable specification the following must apply:

<div class="note informative">
A specification needs to be considered as a container, which consists of one or more specification parts. In order to connect and describe the different specification parts we make use of the PROF vocabulary, designed to describe profiles and specifications. The purpose of an interoperable specification is the reuse of it and its parts, they must therefore each be given webb-scale suitable unique identifiers, for which we use URIs. The interoperable specification must additionally self-identify as an interoperable specification for which we use the INSPEC vocabulary.
</div>

><span id="prof1"></span> **Rule PROF-1:** The "interoperable specification resource" and its parts MUST have URIs and be described with PROF, the interoperable specification resource MUST be typed as `prof:Profile` or `dcterms:Standard` and have a `dcterms:conformsTo` point to `inspec:PROF`

<div class="note informative">
While a specification may consist of many parts only the data vocabularies, terminologies, application profiles and diagrams are considered by the INSPEC profile. These parts must abide by the rules set out below and self-identify as conforming to the relevant INSPEC rule-set. A specification may contain additional parts but these are not considered reusable and they don't need to follow any rules other than PROF-1 above. Subclassing, for the purpose of clarifying which characteristics are expected on a set of instances, complicates reuse. For this reason an interoperable specification makes use of application profiles instead.
</div>

><span id="prof2"></span> **Rule PROF-2:** All specification parts MUST be indicated via the `prof:hasResource` property from the interoperable specification and be typed as `prof:ResourceDescriptor`. An interoperable specification part MAY be a data vocabulary, a terminology, an application profile or a diagram. Other parts may exist but have no prescribed meaning by the interoperable specification profile.

<div class="note informative">
For vocabularies (classes and properties) we make use of RDFS, the standard recommended by the European interoperability framework.
</div>

><span id="prof3"></span> **Rule PROF-3:** Each data vocabulary MUST be detected by `dcterms:conformsTo` pointing to `inspec:RDFS` and MUST be possible to interpret as RDFS-INSPEC.

<div class="note informative">
For terminologies we make use SKOS which is domain independent.
</div>

><span id="prof4"></span> **Rule PROF-4:** Each terminology MUST be detected by `dcterms:conformsTo` pointing to `inspec:SKOS` and MUST be possible to interpret as SKOS-INSPEC.

<div class="note informative">
To describe application profiles we make use of SHACL, which is W3C recommended.
</div>

><span id="prof5"></span> **Rule PROF-5:** Each application profile MUST be detected by `dcterms:conformsTo` pointing to `inspec:SHACL` and MUST be possible to interpret as SHACL-INSPEC

<div class="note informative">
For diagrams we require SVG as this is an open format which allows for interaction, is light weight and is supported by all modern browsers.
</div>

><span id="prof6"></span> **Rule PROF-6:** A diagram MUST be detected by `dcterms:conformsTo` property pointing to `inspec:SVG` and MUST follow SVG-INSPEC

<div class="note informative">
In INSPEC we distinguish between foundational and profile interoperable specification (see [design](design.md#foundational-specifications)). For foundational interoperable specification we require that it introduces at least a data vocabulary or a terminology, and we disallow it from containing an application profile.
</div>

><span id="prof7"></span> **Rule PROF-7:** A **foundational** interoperable specification MUST contain at least one data vocabulary or one terminology, MUST NOT contain an application profile and MUST be typed as `dcterms:Standard`

<div class="note informative">
For the profile interoperable specification the focus is the application profile describing how the data vocabulary (also required), and any terminologies, are used.
</div>

><span id="prof8"></span> **Rule PROF-8:** A **profile** interoperable specification MUST contain at least one application profile and MUST be typed as `prof:Profile`

><span id="prof9"></span> **Rule PROF-9:** A profile interoperable specification MUST list all data vocabularies and terminologies it **uses** in the application profile explicitly as interoperable specification parts

<div class="note informative">
To allow the discovery of all specification parts which are relevant to a specification we require that it explicitly presents and describes all of the parts that it reuses and builds on.
</div>

><span id="prof10"></span> **Rule PROF-10:** Interoperable specification parts that are **reused** (as opposed to **introduced**) SHOULD indicate that by referring to the interoperable specification where they where introduced via the `prof:isInheritedFrom` property

## Rules for data vocabularies - RDFS-INSPEC

RDFS-INSPEC builds on top of the RDF Schema specification by providing the following additional restrictions:

<div class="note informative">
To work in the context of semantic specifications where it is stated explicitly what is included, we need to assume that everything needed is provided in the indicated RDF Datasets.
</div>

><span id="dv1"></span> **Rule DV-1:** A data vocabulary MUST be expressed in a single RDF Dataset.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fn1_1">[1]</a></sup>

<div class="note informative">
TODO
</div>

><span id="dv2"></span> **Rule DV-2:** There MUST be a single "data vocabulary resource" typed as `owl:Ontology` in the RDF Dataset

<div class="note informative">
In order to be reusable the components of the data vocabulary need to be both discoverable, by pointing to the data vocabulary resource, and referenceable, by having URIs.
</div>

><span id="dv3"></span> **Rule DV-3:** All included classes and properties of the data vocabulary MUST point to the "data vocabulary resource" via the `rdfs:isDefinedBy` property

><span id="dv4"></span> **Rule DV-4:** All included classes and properties as well as the data vocabulary resource MUST have URIs

<div class="note informative">
In order to be more self-contained those classes and properties that are needed to introduce new subclasses/-properties may also be included. They however need to be clearly distinguished in order to avoid being confused for local classes and properties.
</div>

><span id="dv5"></span> **Rule DV-5:** Classes and properties from other vocabularies MAY be included in the RDF Dataset, e.g. when being pointed to via `rdfs:subClassOf` and `rdfs:subProperty`, but MUST NOT point to the same "data vocabulary resource" via the `rdfs:isDefinedBy` property

<div class="note informative">
TODO
</div>

><span id="dv6"></span> **Rule DV-6:** The "data vocabulary resource" MUST be indicated via the `dcterms:subject` property from the "interoperable specification part" (introduced in Rule PROF-2).

## Rules for terminologies - SKOS-INSPEC

SKOS-INSPEC builds on top of the SKOS specification by providing the following additional restrictions:

<div class="note informative">
To work in the context of semantic specifications where it is stated explicitly what is included, we need to assume that everything needed is provided in the indicated RDF Datasets.
</div>

><span id="te1"></span> **Rule TE-1:** A terminology MUST be expressed in a single RDF Dataset.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fn1_2">[1]</a></sup>

<div class="note informative">
TODO
</div>

><span id="te2"></span> **Rule TE-2:** There MUST be a single "terminology resource" with a URI typed as `skos:ConceptScheme` in the RDF Dataset

<div class="note informative">
In order to be reusable the components of the terminology need to be both discoverable, by pointing to the terminology resource, and referenceable, by having URIs.
</div>

><span id="te3"></span> **Rule TE-3:** All concepts and collections in the terminology MUST point to the "terminology resource" via the `skos:inScheme` property

><span id="te4"></span> **Rule TE-4:** All concepts, collections as well as the terminology resource MUST have URIs

<div class="note informative">
TODO
</div>

><span id="te5"></span> **Rule TE-5:** The "terminology resource" MUST be indicated via the `dcterms:subject` property from the "interoperable specification part" (introduced in Rule PROF-2).

## Rules for application profiles - SHACL-INSPEC

SHACL-INSPEC builds on top of the SHACL specification by providing additional restrictions. Since SHACL is a rich language the following rules does not cover all situations. For instance, the following rules does not indicate how to specify how to restrict to concepts from a specific terminology. For a more complete treatment see the [SHACL-INSPEC separate document](ap.md) for patterns on how to use the profile in various situations.

<div class="note informative">
To work in the context of semantic specifications where it is stated explicitly what is included, we need to assume that everything needed is provided in the indicated RDF Datasets.
</div>

><span id="ap1"></span> **Rule AP-1:** An application profile MUST be expressed in a single RDF Dataset<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fn2_1">[2]</a></sup>

<div class="note informative">
TODO
</div>

><span id="ap2"></span> **Rule AP-2:** There MUST be a single "application profile resource" with a URI in the RDF Dataset AND it MUST be the same as the "interoperable specification resource" (introduced in Rule PROF-1)

<div class="note informative">
In order to be reusable the components of the application profile, property and node shapes, need to be referenceable, by having a URI. Not all shapes need be reusable however, reusability is therefore determined through the severity of the shape.
</div>

><span id="ap3"></span> **Rule AP-3:** All property shapes with a severity of `sh:Violation` and with at least one constraint (`sh:and` for specialization does not count) are considered **public** and they MUST have URIs

><span id="ap4"></span> **Rule AP-4:** All node shapes with a severity of `sh:Violation` are considered **public** and MUST have URIs

<div class="note informative">
TODO - We distinguish between main and supportive node shapes...
</div>

><span id="ap5"></span> **Rule AP-5:** Public node shapes are considered **main** if they have a target declaration, otherwise they are considered **supportive**

To further facilitate reuse we also require that reusable shapes are provided with a label. While a definition and usage notes further facilitate reuse, these are not mandatory.

><span id="ap6"></span> **Rule AP-6:** All public node shapes, as well as all property shapes pointed to from those, MUST provide a label and MAY also provide a definition and a usage note

<div class="note informative">
We introduce two concepts describing inheritance between reusable shapes, that a shape "refines" another by adding additional constraints to it, or that it is a "variant" of another shape if it relaxes some of its constraints. These relations are expressed on both property and node shapes by the corresponding INSPEC properties in order to make this more easy to query.
</div>

><span id="ap7"></span> **Rule AP-7:** A property shape MAY express that it **refines** a public property shape via both the `inspec:refines` property as well as via a `sh:and` construct, the latter to be compatible with normal SHACL validation.

><span id="ap8"></span> **Rule AP-8:** A property shape MAY express that it is a **variant** of a public property shape via the `inspec:variant` property

<div class="note informative">
A reusable node shape refines another if shares all of the others constraints (property shapes), or refinements of these. A reusable node shape is a variant of another if shares all of the others constraints, or refinements or variants of these with at least one of the constraints being a variant. In both cases the nodes may have additional constraints.
</div>

><span id="ap9"></span> **Rule AP-9:** A node shape *B* MAY express that it **refines** a public node shape *A* via the `inspec:refines` property only if for every property shape *X* in *A* either *X* or a refinement *Y* of *X* is in *B*.

><span id="ap10"></span> **Rule AP-10:** A node shape *B* MAY express that it is a **variant** of a public node shape *A* via the `inspec:variant` property only if for every property shape *X* in *A* either *X* or *Y* is in *B* where *Y* is a refinement or a variant of *X*. At least one of the property shapes must be a variant and not a refinement.

<div class="note informative">
An application profile refines another if it shares all of its constraints (node shapes), or refinements of these. An application profile is a variant of another if shares all of the others constraints, or refinements or variants of these with at least one of the constraints being a variant. In both cases the application profile may have additional constraints. These relations are expressed using the corresponding INSPEC properties.
</div>

><span id="ap11"></span> **Rule AP-11:** An application profile *B* MAY express that it is a **subprofile of** of an application profile *A* via the `inspec:refines` property only if for every node shape *X* in *A* there is a refined node shape *Y* in *B*.

><span id="ap12"></span> **Rule AP-12:** An application profile *B* MAY express that it is a **variant** of a application profile *A* via the `inspec:variant` property only if for every node shape *X* in *A* there is a variant or refined node shape *Y* in *B*, at least one of the node shapes must be a variant and not a refinement.

<div class="note informative">
TODO
</div>

><span id="ap13"></span> **Rule AP-13:** All shapes of the application profile MUST point to the "application profile resource" via the `rdfs:isDefinedBy` property

<div class="note informative">
TODO
</div>

><span id="ap14"></span> **Rule AP-14:** Shapes used for refinement or for variants MAY reside in other RDF Datasets as long as the dataset is pointed to via `owl:imports` AND there is either a `inspec:refines` or a `inspec:variant` relation between the application profile resources.

<div class="note informative">
TODO
</div>

><span id="ap15"></span> **Rule AP-15:** Shapes from other application profiles used for refinement or for variants MAY be included in the RDF Dataset but MUST NOT point to the same "application profile resource" via the `rdfs:isDefinedBy` property

## Rules for diagrams - SVG-INSPEC

SVG-INSPEC builds on top of SVG to provide a way to clarify whether objects in a diagram corresponds to an entity recognized in interoperable specifications, i.e. a class, a property, a node-shape, a property-shape, a concept, a terminology, or a concept collection. Also interoperable specifications or foundational specifications should be possible to indicate as well as diagrams and data vocabularies if they are included in the diagram. Note that there are no hard restrictions on the diagrammatic style used. Although it should be noted that it is good idea to choose a style that is well known like something akin to UML class diagrams.

<div class="note informative">
Note that, as diagrams are not mandatory, an interoperable specification may include a diagram which are not INSPEC compatible (e.g. a bitmap image), as long as this is not marked as conforming to `inspec:SVG`.

In order to make the diagram interactive we require that it explicitly makes clear what entity each visualised element corresponds to. By using href and the URI it becomes possible to navigate between the diagram and the other specification parts.
</div>

><span id="svg1"></span> **Rule SVG-1:** An element corresponding to an INSPEC entity MUST have a href pointing to it's URI. If the element corresponds to two things, e.g. both a class and a node-shape, the URI of the dominant one should be used.

<div class="note informative">
To help with visually classifying elements in the diagram we introduce a data attribute to be added to each element to clarify the type of entity it corresponds to. Multiple values can be listed.
</div>

><span id="svg2"></span> **Rule SVG-2:** An element corresponding to an INSPEC entity MUST have a custom data attribute on the form `data-inspec-type="TYPE"` where TYPE is one of foundational, application-profile, diagram, data-vocabulary, class, property, node-shape, property-shape, concept, terminology and concept-collection. If the element corresponds to two things, e.g. both a class and a node-shape they can be listed both with a separating comma, the first should be considered dominant.

<div class="note informative">
We provide an additional identifier on each element, directly derived from the URI of the corresponding entity. This identifier is compatible with CSS-selectors in order to allow for a more interactive diagram.
</div>

><span id="svg3"></span> **Rule SVG-3:** An element corresponding to an INSPEC entity MAY have an id on the form `id="d_EID"` where EID is the md5 sum<sup><a href="#fn3" id="fn3_1">[3]</a></sup> of the entity's URI.

<div class="note informative">
Further data attributes ar provided to also allow for the encoding of the reusability of a node or property shape and whether a node shape is main or supportive.
</div>

><span id="svg4"></span> **Rule SVG-4:** An element with type node-shape or property-shape MAY have a custom data attribute on the form `data-inspec-public="true"` if it is public according to rule AP-3 or AP-4.

><span id="svg5"></span> **Rule SVG-5:** An element with type node-shape that is also public MAY have a custom data attribute on the form `data-inspec-weight="WEIGHT"` where WEIGHT is either "main" or "supportive" according to rule AP-5.

## Rules for enriching the interoperable specifications - ENRICH-INSPEC

This set of rules aim to enrich the interoperable specification by analysing the contents of, and interaction between, the different interoperable specification parts in order to surface information which may be valuable for a webb of interoperable specifications.

<div class="note informative">
In order to be discoverable the components of the application profile, property and node shapes, should be pointed to from the application profile.
</div>

><span id="enrich1"></span> **Rule ENRICH-1:** Every public property or node shape MAY be pointed to from the "interoperable specification resource" (introduced in Rule PROF-1) via the `dcterms:hasPart` property.

<div class="note informative">
TODO
</div>

><span id="enrich2"></span> **Rule ENRICH-2:** For a profile interoperable specification all classes and properties referred to via shapes MAY be explicitly indicated from the "interoperable specification resource". The indication SHOULD use `inspec:reuses` if the referred resource is part of a **reused** specification part (see Rule PROF-10), otherwise `inspec:introduces` SHOULD be used.

<div class="note informative">
TODO
</div>

><span id="enrich3"></span> **Rule ENRICH-3:** For a foundational interoperable specification all classes and properties defined by (see Rule DV-3) an **introduced** data vocabulary MAY be explicitly indicated from the "interoperable specification resource" using `inspec:introduces`.

<div class="note informative">
TODO
</div>

><span id="enrich4"></span> **Rule ENRICH-4:** If a `inspec:refines` relation is present in the application profile resource the specification introducing the refined application MAY be indicated from the "interoperable specification resource" using `prof:isProfileOf`.

 <li id="fn1">Both RDFS and SKOS introduce building blocks (classes and properties) for defining things (other classes, properties, concepts, collections) in an open world manner.
